**Task 1: Create a New Pluggable Database (PDB)**

At first here we were creating a pluggable database in my container databasewhich is **orcl** using SQL*Plus named **bo_pdb_28308**, which will contain our PDBs and as instructed will be used in all our classâ€™s work and then we also created a user in it which was **Boncoeur_plsqlauca_28308** and it succeeded and below is a screenshot showing it

**Task 2: Create and Delete Another PDB**

The task we had here was to create a PDB to delete where we created another PDB and deleted it right away after seeing that it was created and below are the screenshots showing the success in creation and also deletion.

**Task 3: Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)**

Our task was to configure Oracle Enterprise Manager and show the screenshot of our dashboards showing It is working, it shows the CDB and also the PDB of task1 only because the other I created was deleted before accessing OEM so we are only seeing the 2
